      <h3>Eating 'til It No Longer Hurts</h3>
      <p>There are no foods I won't try. More than that, there are no foods I won't keep trying. My philosophy is: I don't like it, <em>yet</em>.</p>

      <h2>And It Was All Yellow</h2>
      <article>
      <h3>Food doesn't have to be yellow but it could be...</h3>

      <p>Yellow has always been my favorite color. Color is perception. Humans have an innate appreciation for color as well as a culturally adapted one.
      </p>
      <cite><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/the-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory/"><i> 99 Designs</i></a></cite> notes an almost instantaneous reaction to colors and also seems to coincidentally find statistics with the number 9:
      <blockquote>People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on color. </blockquote>
