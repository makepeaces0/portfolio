      <h3>I don't like it, <em>yet</em>.</h3>
      <p>There are no foods I won't try. More than that, there are no foods I won't keep trying. My philosophy is: if it's good for me or it's a delicasy, <em>I will like it!</em></p>

      <h2>And It Was All Yellow</h2>
      <article>
      <h3>Food doesn't have to be yellow but it could be...</h3>
      <p>I have always been attracted to the color yellow. Color is perception, whether inate or cultural.
        <nav><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/the-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory/"> 99 Designs</a></nav> connects an almost instantaneous reaction to colors:
      <blockquote>People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on color. </blockquote></p>
