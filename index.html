      <h3>Eating 'til It No Longer Hurts</h3>
      <p id="lead-paragraph">There are no foods I won't try. More than that, there are no foods I won't keep trying. My philosophy is: I don't like it, <em>yet</em>.</p>
      <p> As a child I was forced to eat foods I really disliked. I remember this one Chinese broth that tasted like feet. My siblings and I sat at the table with these small bowls of feet soup and as I stared at my soup, steaming stink into the air I couldn't understand how anyone would enjoy this. I watched as my brother gulped it down as quickly as possible. Then I turned to my right and my sister was using a straw so she couldn't taste it. I couldn't bring myself to drink it so I just sat there. My mother would always say that I would appreciate it when I got older because I would enjoy all foods. <em>She was right.</em></p>
      <p>I have learned that if I don't like the way something tastes, or its texture, or aroma - all I have to do is keep eating it and eventually I'll start to crave it!</p>

      <h2>And It Was All Yellow</h2>
      <article>
      <h3>Food doesn't have to be yellow but it could be...</h3>

      <p>Color is perception. Humans have an innate appreciation for color as well as a culturally adapted one.
      </p>
      <p>When I was about seven the Might Morphin Power Rangers were a huge hit. My brother and I used to go over to a friend's house to watch it because they had a television. I identified with the Yellow Ranger, probably because she was Asian and the Pink Ranger's girlie persona irritated me. I don't know if this is why yellow is my favorite color, but it is the first time I remember being absolutely infatuated and addicted to yellow.</p>
      <cite><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/the-7-step-guide-to-understanding-color-theory/" class=important><i> 99 Designs</i></a></cite> notes an almost instantaneous reaction to colors and also seems to coincidentally find statistics with the number 9:
      <blockquote>People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based solely on color. </blockquote>
